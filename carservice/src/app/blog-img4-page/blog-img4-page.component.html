<div class="anim-target">
    <h1 class="ms-5"><b>1. Check the Tyre Pressure:</b></h1>
    <img src="assets/blog-img-4-1.webp" height="350px" width="530px" class="d-block mx-auto p-3 anim-target">
    <p class="mx-auto lh-base" style="width: 75%; font-size:1.25rem">Make sure your tyres have the right amount of air.
        Too much or too little air can make your tyres wear out faster. You can check the tyre pressure at a tyre shop
        or do it yourself with a tyre gauge.</p>

<h1 class="ms-5"><b>2. Get Regular Wheel Alignment:</b></h1>
<img src="assets/blog-img-4-2.webp" height="350px" width="530px" class="d-block mx-auto p-3 anim-target">
<p class="mx-auto lh-base" style="width: 75%; font-size:1.25rem">When your wheels are lined up correctly, your tyres
    wear evenly. If your car’s wheels are misaligned, certain parts of the tyres wear out faster. It’s a good idea
    to visit a car tyre shop near you to get your wheel alignment checked, especially if you hit a pothole or
    something.</p>

<h1 class="ms-5"><b>3. Rotate Your Tyres:</b></h1>
<img src="assets/blog-img-4-3.webp" height="350px" width="530px" class="d-block mx-auto p-3 anim-target">
<p class="mx-auto lh-base" style="width: 75%; font-size:1.25rem">Rotating your tyres means moving them from one
    position on the car to another, like switching the front tyres with the back ones. This helps all your tyres
    wear out evenly. You should rotate your tyres every 10000km</p>

<h1 class="ms-5"><b>4. Choose the Right Tyres:</b></h1>
<img src="assets/blog-img-4-4.webp" height="350px" width="530px" class="d-block mx-auto p-3 anim-target">
<p class="mx-auto lh-base" style="width: 75%; font-size:1.25rem">Different tyres are made for different weather and
    roads. If you live where it snows a lot, winter tyres are a good choice. Using the right tyres for your car and
    the weather helps them last longer.</p>

<h1 class="ms-5"><b>5. Balance Your Wheels:</b></h1>
<img src="assets/blog-img-4-5.webp" height="350px" width="530px" class="d-block mx-auto p-3 anim-target">
<p class="mx-auto lh-base" style="width: 75%; font-size:1.25rem">When your wheels are balanced, your car drives
    smoothly, and your tyres wear evenly. If your car shakes or vibrates while driving, it might be time to get your
    wheels balanced at a tyre shop.</p>


<h1 class="ms-5"><b>6. Drive Gently:</b></h1>
<img src="assets/blog-img-4-6.webp" height="350px" width="530px" class="d-block mx-auto p-3 anim-target">
<p class="mx-auto lh-base" style="width: 75%; font-size:1.25rem">The way you drive affects how long your tyres last.
    Fast stops, quick starts, and sharp turns can wear out your tyres faster. If you drive smoothly, your tyres will
    stay in good shape longer.</p>

<h1 class="ms-5"><b>7. Check for Damage:</b></h1>
<img src="assets/blog-img-4-7.webp" height="350px" width="530px" class="d-block mx-auto p-3 anim-target">
<p class="mx-auto lh-base" style="width: 75%; font-size:1.25rem">Every now and then, look at your tyres for cuts,
    bulges, or anything stuck in them. If you see something wrong, go to a car tyre shop near you for help. Fixing
    small problems early can save you from having to buy new tyres.</p>


<h1 class="ms-5"><b>8. Store Your Tyres Properly:</b></h1>

<p class="mx-auto lh-base pb-3" style="width: 75%; font-size:1.25rem">If you have extra tyres, like winter tyres,
    store
    them in a cool, dry place away from sunlight. This keeps them from getting damaged.</p>
