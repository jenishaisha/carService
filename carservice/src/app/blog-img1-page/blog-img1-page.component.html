<p class="text-center mx-auto" style="width: 75%; font-size:1rem">Maintaining the correct tyre pressure reduces rolling
    resistance, ensuring your car uses less energy and fuel to move
    forward. Check your tyre pressure monthly and adjust as needed to match your car’s specifications.</p>

<h1 class="m-5"><b>2. Use the Correct Motor Oil</b></h1>

<p class="text-center mx-auto" style="width: 75%; font-size:1rem">Using the recommended grade of motor oil for your car
    reduces engine friction, enhancing fuel efficiency. High-quality synthetic oils can also extend the time between oil
    changes.

<h1 class="m-5"><b>3. Use Cruise Control</b></h1>

<p class="text-center mx-auto" style="width: 75%; font-size:1rem">On highways, cruise control helps maintain a constant
    speed, reducing unnecessary speed fluctuations and improving fuel efficiency by up to 7%.</p>

<h1 class="m-5"><b> 4. Regular Engine Maintenance</b></h1>

<p class="text-center mx-auto" style="width: 75%; font-size:1rem">Keep your engine well-maintained by following the
    manufacturer’s service schedule. Regularly replace air filters, spark plugs, and fuel filters to ensure optimal
    engine performance and fuel efficiency</p>

<h1 class="m-5"><b> 5. Reduce Vehicle Weight</b></h1>

    means more energy and fuel are needed to move your vehicle, so keep your car as light as possible.</p>
